# oh-my-cli

The guides in this repo are meant to help you:
* ...make your CLI experience much cooler.
* ...get past your fear and frustration with using vim.
* ...assimilate tmux into your workflow (and be excited about it).

***

## First, do this:

In a hurry? An installer script that installs all the cool tools for you for you is available [here](scripts/install-cool-tools.sh).  Please note the script will alias `ls`, `cd` and `cat` to their new, cooler, replacements.  If you don't like that, you can undo this by removing the alias entries from your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file.

The list below are setup steps for some cool CLI tools, including:

> Note: This list is also the recommended order of installation.

* **[oh-my-zsh](cool-tools/install-zsh-powerlevel10k-and-plugins.md)** and **[Powerlevel10k](cool-tools/install-zsh-powerlevel10k-and-plugins.md)** - a zsh framework and great zsh theme
* **[bat](cool-tools/bat.md)** - a better **`cat`**
* **[eza](cool-tools/eza.md)** - a better **`ls`**
* **[zoxide](cool-tools/zoxide.md)** - a better **`cd`**
* **[fzf](cool-tools/fzf.md)** - a fuzzy finder for the CLI
  * [integrating eza & bat with fzf](cool-tools/integrating-eza-and-bat-with-fzf.md)
* **[tldr](cool-tools/tldr.md)** - a more concise **`man`** page
* (coming soon) - **[thefuck](cool-tools/tldr.md)** - a CLI typo fixer
